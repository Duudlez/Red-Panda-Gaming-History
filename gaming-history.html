            <h1><b>The History of Video Games: From Pong to modern AAA Titles</b></h1>
            <p>The evolution of video games is a fascinating journey through decades of technological advancements,
                creativity, and cultural impact. Let's explore this history, from the humble beginnings of gaming to the
                expansive worlds of today's blockbuster AAA titles.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>The Birth of Video Games (1950s-1970s)</h2>
            <h3>The Dawn of Interactive Entertainment</h3>
            <p>In the early 1950s, computer scientists were experimenting with interactive programs. One of the earliest
                examples, Tennis for Two (1958), created by physicist William Higinbotham, allowed players to simulate a
                simple tennis game on an oscilloscope.</p>
            <h3>Pong and the Arcade Revolution</h3>
            <p>The real breakthrough came in 1972 with Pong, developed by Atari. This simplistic yet addictive table
                tennis game became a commercial sensation, kickstarting the arcade gaming industry. Fun fact: The first
                Pong machine reportedly broke down because the coin slot was jammed with quarters!</p>

            <h2>The Rise of Home Consoles (1970s-1980s)</h2>
            <h3>The Console Wars Begin</h3>
            <p>In the late 1970s, home consoles like the Atari 2600 brought video games into living rooms. Titles like
                Space Invaders and Pac-Man dominated, cementing gaming as a mainstream pastime.</p>
            <h3>The Crash of 1983</h3>
            <p>The early 1980s saw an oversaturation of low-quality games, leading to the infamous Video Game Crash of
                1983. One of the culprits? E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, often cited as one of the worst games ever made,
                with unsold cartridges allegedly buried in a landfill.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>The Golden Age of Gaming (1980s-1990s)</h2>
            <h3>Nintendo and the 8-bit Era</h3>
            <p>Nintendo revitalized the industry with the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) in 1985. Iconic games like
                Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda set new standards for gameplay and storytelling.</p>
            <h3>16-bit Wars: Sega vs. Nintendo</h3>
            <p>The 1990s saw fierce competition between Sega and Nintendo. The Sega Genesis brought us Sonic the
                Hedgehog, while the Super Nintendo (SNES) introduced timeless classics like Super Metroid. This era also
                saw the rise of handheld gaming with the Game Boy and Tetris.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>3D Graphics and the Birth of Modern Gaming (1990s-2000s)</h2>
            <h3>The Leap to 3D</h3>
            <p>The mid-90s ushered in a 3D revolution with consoles like the Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64. Games
                like Final Fantasy VII, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and Metal Gear Solid demonstrated the
                potential of 3D graphics and cinematic storytelling.</p>
            <h3>PC Gaming Emerges</h3>
            <p>Around the same time, PC gaming gained traction with titles like Doom, Half-Life, and StarCraft. LAN
                parties and online multiplayer were the precursors to modern esports.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>The Rise of AAA Gaming (2000s-2010s)</h2>
            <h3>High Budgets, High Stakes</h3>
            <p>By the 2000s, game development had become a massive industry. Titles like Grand Theft Auto V, The Elder
                Scrolls V: Skyrim, and Call of Duty series exemplified AAA gaming—blockbuster titles with huge budgets,
                intricate worlds, and massive audiences.</p>
            <h3>Indie Games and Digital Distribution</h3>
            <p>Not all successes came from big studios. Indie games like Minecraft and Undertale, enabled by digital
                platforms like Steam, showcased the creativity of small teams and reshaped the industry.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Today's Gaming Landscape (2010s-Present)</h2>
            <h3>Open Worlds and Live Services</h3>
            <p>Modern gaming is defined by open-world exploration and live-service models. Games like The Witcher 3 and
                Fortnite offer immersive experiences and continuous updates to keep players engaged.</p>
            <h3>Virtual Reality and Beyond</h3>
            <p>The advent of VR (Virtual Reality) with platforms like Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR is transforming how
                we experience games. Meanwhile, AI and cloud gaming are set to define the future of the industry.</p>
            <p>The evolution of video games is not just a timeline of technological progress but a testament to human
                creativity and the universal desire for play. From humble beginnings to immersive virtual worlds, the
                future of gaming is boundless.</p>
